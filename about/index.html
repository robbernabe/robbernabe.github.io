================

I've been working with computers since the early 90s. I fell in love with the intricacies of TCP/IP and Linux after being
introduced to both by a friend of mine, and shortly thereafter built a lab in my home when I was a teenager (it took up
most of my parents' bedroom, they weren't very happy about that). I love solving interesting problems, building useful tools,
and automating repetitive tasks. You'll most often find me working in the terminal, where I feel at home.

I live in NYC with my wife and two children. Besides technology, I have a passion for Okinawa Karate. I started training when I
was around 9 years old with <a href="http://www.thehouseofkarate.com/bio.htm">Sensei George Smith</a>. I've also had the honor
and privilege of training in Naha, Okinawa with great masters such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiichi_Miyazato">Eiichi Miyazato</a>,
Yoshishige Omine, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masaji_Taira">Masaji Taira</a>. My primary areas of study are history,
body mechanics, kata and bunkai.
