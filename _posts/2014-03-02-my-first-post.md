I've been wanting to start my blog for a while now. Mostly because I'd like to have a place to share my "debug logs". I was
introduced to the concept by a post in Hacker News.

If you've ever fixed a time-consuming problem once, never took any notes on how you solved it, then you'll know the value in keeping debug logs.
We've all done this before. We say to ourselves, "Oh this wasn't too bad, I'll remember this", but we never do. Then we end up
solving the same problem we solved previously. What a waste of time!

Up to this point I've been using Evernote, but that doesn't help anyone but myself. I'm hoping that by publishing my debug logs
here on my blog that they'll help others encountering the same issues. Over time I'll try to add my historical debug logs as well.

See you soon!
